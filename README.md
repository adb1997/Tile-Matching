This repository contains the Tile Matching game that I had implemented during the Rapid Prototyping of Computer Systems (18-745) class this semester. 
It is part of the Short Term Memory assessment section of the whole system known as Plume which would be used by patients suffering from Parkinson's disease.
The game is basic with a simple UI developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

You can play the game here - https://adb1997.github.io/Tile-Matching/
